### Simplifying Mathematical Functions

When simplifying functions, we apply specific math rules to reduce complexity while maintaining equivalence. Below are the main rules, each with a simple example.

---

#### 1. **Combining Like Terms**  
- **Rule:** Add or subtract coefficients of terms with the same variable and exponent.  
- **Example:**  
  3x + 5x = 8x

---

#### 2. **Distributive Property**  
- **Rule:** Multiply the term outside the parentheses by each term inside the parentheses.  
- **Example:**  
  3(x + 4) = 3x + 12

---

#### 3. **Factoring Common Terms**  
- **Rule:** Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from all terms.  
- **Example:**  
  6x + 9 = 3(2x + 3)

---

#### 4. **Power of a Power**  
- **Rule:** Multiply exponents when raising a power to another power.  
- **Example:**  
  (x^2)^3 = x^(2 * 3) = x^6

---

#### 5. **Product of Powers**  
- **Rule:** Add exponents when multiplying terms with the same base.  
- **Example:**  
  x^2 * x^3 = x^(2 + 3) = x^5

---

#### 6. **Quotient of Powers**  
- **Rule:** Subtract exponents when dividing terms with the same base.  
- **Example:**  
  x^5 / x^2 = x^(5 - 2) = x^3

---

#### 7. **Zero Exponent Rule**  
- **Rule:** Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1.  
- **Example:**  
  x^0 = 1

---

#### 8. **Negative Exponents**  
- **Rule:** Rewrite as the reciprocal with a positive exponent.  
- **Example:**  
  x^(-3) = 1 / x^3
